		<h2>The Moocats</h2>
		<br></br>
		<b class="intro">Moocats you say ?</b>
		<p class="intro">In a puerile sense it is perhaps the first thing that comes to mind when
		you spot one of them.  Given their bovine coloration 
		like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holstein_Friesian_cattle">Holstein Cow</a>
		they are easy to spot.  Since I moved into my current house they have been scurrying around and
		trying to get into my room to use the instant pot like a jacuzzi.  They are ill-behaved and have a bevy
		of bad habits.

		<p class="intro">
		<b>LEFT PIC:</b> Moocat(the one on the right) is the eponymous ring leader. He usually leads the crew when 
		they get into shenanigans, which mostly consist of stealing aluminum cans to fund their malt liquor habit.
		Next to Moocat is Cowlita, his younger sister and taciturn long time accomplice. 
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<b>RIGHT PIC:</b> Cowcat is Moocat's BFF , partner in crime and , like the whole crew, is a miscreant feline
		of low moral fiber.

		Though they don't belong to the same species,  Moopig and Moobun have been inducted as honorary members
		of the Moocat tribe after surviving a harrowing initiation and hazing ceremony.
