		<p class="intro">The phenomenon of Stuffedbeeps started with the <b>D-Sisters: Dido, Dada and Didi</b>.  Dido came to
		earth many years ago and crash landed in lovely Modesto, California.  After falling in with the wrong crowd on the mean
		streets of San Joaquin County, Dido hitched a ride on the back of a trailer-tractor headed to San Jose where she eventually
		ended up in the toy aisle of a Walgreens and later in my home.  Dido's sister <b>Didi</b> came some months afterwards, drawn 
		by her sister's promise of large amounts of partying to be had on the planet Earth.  Didi is a party animal.  <b>Dada</b>, the
		older and responsible sister came last, to watch after her wayward siblings and keep them from going too far off into the deep end.

		    <p>Some fun facts about the D-Sisters:
		    <ul>
			    <li> They speak binary (zeros and ones) in a super fast barely audible series of low and high beeps
					some have theorized this is why they are called "squeakbeeps"
				</li>
				<li> Dido is a techinal genius and finds relaxation reading Cisco switch operation manuals
				</li>
				<li>Dada is proficient on both oboe and english horn.  She once auditoned for the New York Metropolitan Opera
				    but they refused to hire her because she doesn't speak English
				</li>

		<b>LEFT PIC:</b>Stuffed into the pint glass on bottom is <b>Chikki </b>she is an innocent and has fallen under
		the tutelage of <b>Carmine</b>(on top in pint glass).  Carmine is a refugee from South Philadephia and used to
		run stolen cigarrettes with the mob until he stepped on one too many sets of toes with his big mouth and decided
		to come out west for safety.
		<b>RIGHT PIC:</b> In the right pic, <b>Ernesto</b> is a mischievous little guy with a cute protruding tooth (teefy) 
		jutting out from his lower jaw.  I wish I could say more about him but he doesn't speak English.
